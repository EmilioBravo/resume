# Resume/CV Luis Escobar Bravo

Creative PHP Developer with 12+ years of experience in IT and open source enthusiast.

I am a very proactive person, I love solving problems, I've worked for several years with [ONIRIA](https://www.oniria.com.py/), the most important Advertising Agency from Paraguay, so I'm used to work with non tech people, designers, copywriters and creatives.

The last 5 years I've used mostly the Laravel Framework to create simple websites and complex web applications.

I've developed hybrid mobile apps using Cordova, Phonegap and Ionic, integrated with custom backend APIs.

I have strong experience setting up Linux web, database and mail servers where I host my clients and my own projects.
